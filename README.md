Door Locked Predictor
This project is a  application that predicts whether a door is locked based on user-provided input. It uses a frequency-table approach to make predictions and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction.


# Features
## Prediction System:


Predicts whether a door is locked based on input features such as:
Has Key
Door Type
Time of Day
Location

------------

## Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Allows users to input feature values and view predictions.
Includes options to add new data to the dataset.

------------

## Data Management:


Reads and writes data to a CSV file (full_data.csv).
Automatically removes rows beyond a specified limit (200 rows) after the user is done.

------------

## Accuracy Calculation:


Splits the dataset into training and testing data to calculate prediction accuracy.
It checks if both data sets have the same answer(doorislocked). If yes than it counts to 
a correct prediction. Then correct prediction is being divided by the total * by 100.

# Project Structure
## src/com/oopproject/Control.java:

Entry point of the application. Initializes the frequency table and launches the GUI.

------------

## src/com/oopproject/Gui.java:

------------

## Implements the graphical user interface using Swing.
Handles user input and interactions.

------------

## src/com/oopproject/Frequency.java:

Manages the frequency table and CSV file operations.
Provides methods for prediction, accuracy calculation, and data management.

------------

# How It Works
## Data Loading:

The application reads data from full_data.csv and creates a frequency table.

------------

## Prediction:

Based on user input, the application searches the frequency table for matching rows and predicts whether the door is locked.

------------

## Adding Data:

Users can add new rows to the dataset via the GUI. The data is appended to the CSV file.

------------

## Accuracy Calculation:

The dataset is split into training and testing subsets to evaluate the prediction accuracy.

------------

## Row Management:

Ensures the dataset does not exceed 200 rows by removing excess rows.

------------

# Prerequisites

## CSV File: Ensure full_data.csv exists in the specified path with the following headers:
HasKey,DoorType,TimeOfDay,Location,DoorIsLocked

------------

# Example Usage
Launch the application.
Input feature values (e.g., Has Key, Door Type, etc.) in the GUI.
Click Predict to see the prediction result.
Optionally, add new data to the dataset using the Add button.

------------

# File Details
## full_data.csv:
Stores the dataset used for predictions.

## Example row:
Yes,Metal,Night,Urban,Yes

------------

# Frequency Table for the Dataset
The frequency table for the dataset `full_data.csv` is as follows:

| Column 1 (Yes/No) | Column 2 (Material) | Column 3 (Time) | Column 4 (Location) | Column 5 (Yes/No) | Frequency |
|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Yes               | Wooden              | Night           | Urban               | No                | X         |
| No                | Metal               | Night           | Rural               | Yes               | X         |
| ...               | ...                 | ...             | ...                 | ...               | ...       |

(*Replace `X` with the actual frequency values generated by your program.*)
